                    The ticket, not the bet slip, shall be the only valid proof of the selections made and the only valid instrument for claiming a prize.

Players must be 18 years or older to purchase tickets.

By purchasing a ticket, you agree to be bound by all rules and regulations of the DC Lottery. By purchasing a ticket and submitting a prize claim, each potential winner grants the DC Lottery the right to use the winnerâ€™s name, city, county, state of residence, prize amount and photograph or likeness to publicize his or her winnings. The potential winner also authorizes DC Lottery to advertise and promote games or goodwill for the DC Lottery in any print, broadcast, electronic, Internet or other form of media whatsoever, without further consideration.

Prizes must be claimed within 180 days from the date of the drawing.

Complete DC-2 game rules may be obtained from the DC Lottery upon request
